	<p>We build images on a daily base. This is how we shape reality; we observe and create an image of what we see. From this we draw conclusions. Graphic designers can adopt a strong position to control the perception or raise a question about it. Being a human and graphic designer I feel the urge to host narratives a platform and offer them a future by illuminating different points of view. Bringing up various points of view can help us to gain an understanding of how other people experience their world. And it helps us also to get to new notions.</p>

            <p> By reflecting on the work I made in the last five years, I came to the conclusion that I find it very important to address a different vision on a situation throughout my work. Where does this fascination come from? Since I was young I was thought that a situation can be perceived from different angles. What is the influence of this fact on me as a person and a graphic designer?</p>

            <p> This theses is an exploration on how graphic designers and artists use innovative framing in their work. How does (re)framing work and what are the artistic means that designers use to implement this? My goal is to discover the key elements of reframing and how I can use this to create better and meaningful work.
</p>


            <p>The schema we use to organize our lives and get a grip on how we perceive reality. They are filters, where things are being highlighted and pushed aside. A frame, or frame of reference is a complex schema of unquestioned beliefs, values and so on that we use when inferring meaning. If any part of that frame is changed, then the meaning that is inferred may change. This is called reframing. Reframing challenges the assumptions of things and makes you question what you see. Interpretation is very important when thinking about reframing. My research within social psychiatry has shown me the importance of reframing problems. By deconstructing a situation, other connections can be made. This can lead to innovative and unexpected solutions. 
</p>

    <p>To interpret is to make meaningful connections between what we see and what we have seen and experienced before. Designers have the power to (re)create narratives and control the proces of conveying and shaping meaning. Getting people to look at things differently. Context is very important. By placing things in a different context, the impact can be more up close and personal for the spectator. It will hit a spot that the mainstream images wonâ€™t reach. A designer has to search for the right portal to give a unexpected twist on the situation. Manipulation and detournement (rerouting or hijacking) can be a part of this too. All these aspects an be implemented into design. That is were it itches, that is where the magic happens..
